I am a PhD candidate in the lab of Matthijs van der Meer in the Psychological and Brain Sciences department at Dartmouth College. I am broadly interested in the neural dynamics that support decision-making. My current focus in the van der Meer lab is understanding how coordinated activity within the nucleus accumbens contributes to the efficient pursuit of goals.
I utilize in vivo extracellular electrophysiology to monitor neural activity while rodents engage in a variety of reward-guided behaviors, and make inferences about the relationship between neural activity and behavior using modern statistical methods.
