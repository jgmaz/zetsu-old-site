I am a PhD candidate in the lab of <a href="http://www.vandermeerlab.org/" target="_blank">Matthijs van der Meer</a> in the <a href="https://pbs.dartmouth.edu/" target="_blank">Psychological and Brain Sciences</a> department at Dartmouth College. I am broadly interested in the neural dynamics that support decision-making. My current focus in the van der Meer lab is understanding how coordinated activity within the nucleus accumbens contributes to the efficient pursuit of goals.
I utilize <i>in vivo</i> electrophysiology to monitor neural activity while rodents engage in a variety of reward-guided behaviors, and make inferences about the relationship between neural activity and behavior using modern statistical methods.
