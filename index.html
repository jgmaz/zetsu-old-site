I am a post-doc in <a href="https://beneuro.ic.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Juan Gallego's group</a> in the Department of Bioengineering at Imperial College London. Broadly, I am interested in the neural dynamics that support flexible behaviour. My current focus is in combining detailed investigation of rodent behaviour with large-scale neural recordings and contemporary population-level analyses to gain insights into cortical and subcortical computations during feedback-mediated motor control.

Previously, I completed my PhD at Dartmouth in the lab of <a href="http://www.vandermeerlab.org/" target="_blank">Matthijs van der Meer</a> where I studied the flexible processing of motivationally-relevant information in the rodent nucleus accumbens. Before Dartmouth, I started my research career with <a href="https://www.wlu.ca/academics/faculties/faculty-of-science/faculty-profiles/bruce-mckay/index.html" target="_blank">Bruce McKay</a> at Wilfrid Laurier University where I investigated the effects of the abused solvent toluene on various aspects of neural function.
